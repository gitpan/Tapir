NAME
    Tapir - A Thrift-based rapid API framework

DESCRIPTION
    Tapir sets forth a way to declare an API framework that's protocol and
    transport agnostic. It provides for strict datatyping (via Thrift) and
    automatic documentation with easy deployment scenarios over HTTP, AMQP
    or some other transport of your choice. The core of the implementation
    is asynchronous but can be called in a synchronous environment so long
    as your method implementation doesn't use asynchronous logic.
