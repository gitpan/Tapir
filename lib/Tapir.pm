=head1 NAME

Tapir - A Thrift-based rapid API framework

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Tapir sets forth a way to declare an API framework that's protocol and transport agnostic.  It provides for strict datatyping (via L<Thrift>) and automatic documentation with easy deployment scenarios over HTTP, AMQP or some other transport of your choice.  The core of the implementation is asynchronous but can be called in a synchronous environment so long as your method implementation doesn't use asynchronous logic.
